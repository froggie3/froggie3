I use these depends on my feeling and cases:

- PHP 🐘
- Python 🐍
- TypeScript (JavaScript)

I'm learning them simultaniously, what I aim for this is to learn basic matters to know in coding. 
It's not sure to be if I have ability to build a nice project, but I will keep learning!

Currently learning: SQL, Algorithm (but I can't do math well), React, Svelte
